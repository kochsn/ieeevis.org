The IEEE VIS 2020 Poster Program offers a timely venue to present and discuss original work or highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue (please see the plagiarism statement in the end) through a forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration, and active engagement with IEEE VIS participants.

In line with the full conference, the presentation of posters will take place online. There will be 1-2 dedicated poster sessions in which poster authors can virtually meet and discuss their work with conference participants. An additional web presence of posters will replace the traditional physical installation of poster boards. More concrete details will follow soon.

In addition to the electronic poster and its virtual presentation, the submitted two-page summary will be included in the electronic conference proceedings.

Examples of appropriate visualization work include, but are not limited to:

* research exploring new problems or areas,
* results of pilot projects,
* new angles on existing (collections of) work or known datasets,
* work-in-progress presented prior to its full publication,
* any work that might particularly benefit from demonstration to and
  active discussion with the visualization community,
* the application of visualization techniques to
  specific application areas, and 
* highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue.

### INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Poster authors must submit a two-page summary of their work in the VGTC conference two-column format in line with the [IEEE VIS Posters’ formatting guidelines](http://vgtc.org/publications/conference), using the poster format.

Summaries should include a concise description of the idea, the results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion of the implications of the work to the selected domain. Full literature searches are not expected, although relevant citations should be included.

Authors whose posters are accepted for IEEE VIS will be asked to refine their two-page summaries based upon feedback from reviewers and submit an electronic poster.

The electronic posters will be created using a provided web-based interface. Access to this interface will be granted after the two-page summary has been accepted for presentation.
  

Presenters are also encouraged to submit an accompanying video or other supplementary materials by following the IEEE VIS formatting guidelines: <http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/supplement.html>.

Visit the [Posters FAQ](posters-faq) page for some useful tips for authors.

* Information Visualization (InfoVis) - for conference themes see 
  [IEEE InfoVis 2020 – Topics and Paper Types](infovis-paper-types)
* Scientific Visualization (SciVis) - for conference themes see 
  [IEEE SciVis 2020 – Topics and Paper Types](scivis-paper-types)

### Plagiarism
All submissions must be either: 1) original work that has not been presented previously at any workshop, symposium, or conference, and not published previously in any archived conference proceeding, magazine, or journal; or 2) a summary that highlights work presented or published in a related venue with a clear statement of attribution to the original work.

At the time of submission, it is required by the authors to state explicitly in the submission form that the submitted work is the work by the authors themselves, or is a summary of previously presented/published work with clear attribution. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and will lead to a removal of the submission from the review process.

### POSTER SESSION

There will be one dedicated poster presentation session in which the virtual posters will be presented. During the time of this session, one or more authors have to be available online at their electronic poster to discuss their work. More details will follow soon.

### POSTER REVIEW PROCESS

Each poster submission will be read and evaluated by at least two reviewers. All authors will receive reviews of their submission explaining the decision and providing feedback. Authors of posters that are accepted, are expected to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to final submission.

### BEST POSTER RESEARCH AWARDS 

The ‘Best Poster Research’ awards will recognize the most significant research contributions based on the submitted two-page poster summary. These awards will be noted in the program and presented with a signed certificate. 

### BEST POSTER DESIGN AWARDS

One poster from each conference will be awarded for ‘Best Poster Design’, which recognizes exemplary use of the virtual poster medium to communicate their research. This will be judged based on the clarity and design of the virtual poster and its presentation by the author(s). Authors of awarded posters will receive a signed certificate.
